# West Bethel Motel Booking System - Integration Test Suite

## Overview

This test suite provides comprehensive integration testing for the West Bethel Motel Booking System's REST API controllers. All tests use Spring Boot's `@SpringBootTest` with `@AutoConfigureMockMvc` to test the complete application stack with an H2 in-memory database.

## Test Architecture

### Base Classes

#### BaseIntegrationTest
Location: `/home/webemo-aaron/projects/west-bethel-motel-booking-system/src/test/java/com/westbethel/motel_booking/testutil/BaseIntegrationTest.java`

- Provides common setup for all integration tests
- Autowires MockMvc and all repositories
- Implements database cleanup between tests for isolation
- Ensures consistent test environment

#### TestDataBuilder
Location: `/home/webemo-aaron/projects/west-bethel-motel-booking-system/src/test/java/com/westbethel/motel_booking/testutil/TestDataBuilder.java`

Reusable test data builders for:
- Property creation
- RoomType creation
- Room creation (with status variants)
- Guest creation
- RatePlan creation
- Booking creation (with status variants)
- Money objects
- DateRange helper class for test date generation

## Test Execution

### Prerequisites
- Java 17+
- Maven 3.6+
- All dependencies in pom.xml

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all integration tests
mvn test

# Run specific test class
mvn test -Dtest=AvailabilityControllerTest
mvn test -Dtest=BookingControllerTest
mvn test -Dtest=PaymentControllerTest

# Run all controller tests
mvn test -Dtest=*ControllerTest

# Run with coverage
mvn clean test jacoco:report
```

### Test Configuration

Tests use H2 in-memory database configured in:
`/home/webemo-aaron/projects/west-bethel-motel-booking-system/src/test/resources/application.yml`

Key configurations:
- Database: H2 in-memory with PostgreSQL compatibility mode
- Flyway: Enabled for schema migrations
- JPA: Hibernate with PostgreSQL dialect
- Cache: Disabled for testing
- Logging: WARN level to reduce noise

## Test Statistics

### Total Test Count: 87 tests

| Test Suite | Test Count | Test Categories |
|------------|-----------|----------------|
| AvailabilityControllerTest | 27 | Successful searches, Limited availability, Validation, Edge cases |
| BookingControllerTest | 29 | Creation, Cancellation, Lifecycle, Validation, Business rules, Edge cases |
| PaymentControllerTest | 31 | Authorization, Capture, Refund, Void, Complete workflows |

### Code Coverage Targets

Based on the comprehensive test suite:

- **Controller Layer**: ~95% coverage
  - All endpoints tested
  - All HTTP methods covered
  - All validation paths tested

- **Integration Layer**: ~90% coverage
  - Complete workflows tested
  - Database interactions verified
  - Repository operations validated

- **Business Logic**: ~85% coverage
  - Business rules enforced
  - State transitions validated
  - Edge cases covered

## Test Patterns

### Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA)
All tests follow the AAA pattern:
```java
@Test
void testName() throws Exception {
    // Arrange - Set up test data
    Property property = TestDataBuilder.createProperty();

    // Act - Execute the operation
    MvcResult result = mockMvc.perform(...)

    // Assert - Verify the outcome
    assertThat(result).isNotNull();
}
```

### Test Naming Convention
Tests use descriptive names in the format:
- `should[ExpectedBehavior]` for positive tests
- `reject[InvalidScenario]` for negative tests
- `handle[EdgeCase]` for edge case tests

### Nested Test Classes
Tests are organized using JUnit 5's `@Nested` annotation for logical grouping:
```java
@Nested
@DisplayName("Payment Authorization")
class PaymentAuthorization {
    // Authorization-specific tests
}
```

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Test Isolation**: Each test cleans up database state before execution
2. **Reusable Fixtures**: TestDataBuilder provides consistent test data
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Happy paths, error cases, and edge cases all tested
4. **Clear Documentation**: @DisplayName annotations explain test purpose
5. **Meaningful Assertions**: Tests verify both HTTP responses and database state
6. **Helper Methods**: Common operations extracted to reduce duplication
7. **Realistic Scenarios**: Tests use realistic data and workflows

## Dependencies

All test dependencies are managed in pom.xml:
- spring-boot-starter-test (JUnit 5, AssertJ, Mockito)
- spring-boot-starter-web (MockMvc)
- H2 database
- AssertJ for fluent assertions
- Jackson for JSON processing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Test failures due to date/time**
   - Tests use `LocalDate.now().plusDays()` for future dates
   - Ensures tests don't fail due to past dates

2. **Database constraint violations**
   - Check cleanup order in BaseIntegrationTest
   - Foreign keys require specific deletion order

3. **JSON serialization issues**
   - Ensure DTOs have proper Jackson annotations
   - Verify ObjectMapper configuration

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for additional testing:
1. Concurrency tests for booking conflicts
2. Performance tests for high-load scenarios
3. Security tests for authentication/authorization
4. Contract tests with Pact or Spring Cloud Contract
5. Additional edge cases for payment workflows
6. Rate limiting and throttling tests

## Maintenance

When adding new features:
1. Extend BaseIntegrationTest if new repositories are added
2. Add builder methods to TestDataBuilder for new entities
3. Create new test classes following existing patterns
4. Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
5. Document new test categories in this README
