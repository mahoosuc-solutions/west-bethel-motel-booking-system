# PCI DSS Compliance Checklist
## West Bethel Motel Booking System

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-23
**Compliance Level:** SAQ A (Card-not-present e-commerce, outsourced payment processing)
**Payment Processor:** Stripe (PCI DSS Level 1 Service Provider)

---

## Executive Summary

This checklist covers PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) compliance requirements for the West Bethel Motel Booking System. Since we use Stripe for payment processing and do not store, process, or transmit cardholder data directly, we qualify for **SAQ A** (Self-Assessment Questionnaire A), the simplest compliance level.

**Key Strategy:** Minimize PCI scope by never handling raw card data
- Use Stripe Elements/Checkout for all payment collection
- Never log, store, or transmit full card numbers
- Tokenize all payment methods immediately

## Requirement 3: Protect Stored Cardholder Data

### 3.1 Data Storage Policy

**✅ CRITICAL: We DO NOT store cardholder data**

Our implementation uses Stripe's recommended approach:
1. **Payment Form:** Use Stripe Elements (JavaScript widget)
2. **Tokenization:** Card data goes directly to Stripe
3. **Token Storage:** We store only Stripe payment method tokens
4. **No PAN:** Full Primary Account Number never touches our systems

### 3.2 Verification Checklist
- [x] **No Full PAN Storage:** Confirmed - only Stripe tokens stored
- [x] **No CVV Storage:** Confirmed - CVV never reaches our backend
- [x] **No Expiry Date Storage:** Confirmed - Stripe handles expiry
- [x] **No Cardholder Name Storage:** Confirmed - Stripe handles
- [x] **Database Encryption:** Cloud SQL encrypted at rest
- [x] **Secure Token Storage:** Payment tokens encrypted in database

**Code Review Points:**
- [ ] Search codebase for "card", "pan", "cvv", "ccv"
- [ ] Verify no logging of sensitive data
- [ ] Confirm Stripe.js implementation (client-side only)

**SQL to verify:**
```sql
-- Should return no results
SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND (column_name LIKE '%card%'
     OR column_name LIKE '%pan%'
     OR column_name LIKE '%cvv%');
```

---

## Requirement 4: Encrypt Transmission of Cardholder Data

### 4.1 Encryption in Transit
- [x] **TLS 1.2+:** All communications use TLS 1.2 or higher
- [x] **HTTPS Enforcement:** HTTP redirects to HTTPS
- [x] **Stripe Integration:** Stripe.js uses secure HTTPS
- [ ] **Strong Ciphers:** Configure strong cipher suites only
- [ ] **HSTS Headers:** Strict-Transport-Security enabled

### 4.2 Configuration
```yaml
# Load Balancer TLS Configuration
ssl_protocols: TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3
ssl_ciphers: HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5
hsts_header: "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload"
```

**Testing:**
- [ ] Run SSL Labs test (A+ rating required)
- [ ] Verify TLS 1.0/1.1 disabled
- [ ] Test HSTS header presence
- [ ] Verify no mixed content warnings

## Stripe Integration Best Practices

### Implementation Checklist
- [x] **Stripe.js Library:** Use latest version
- [x] **Stripe Elements:** Payment form component
- [x] **Client-side Tokenization:** Card data → Stripe token
- [x] **Backend:** Only receives Stripe tokens
- [x] **No PCI Scope:** Payment data never touches our servers

### Code Example (Frontend)
```javascript
// CORRECT: Client-side tokenization
const stripe = Stripe('pk_live_...');
const elements = stripe.elements();
const cardElement = elements.create('card');

// Card data goes directly to Stripe
const {token, error} = await stripe.createToken(cardElement);
// Only send token to our backend
const response = await fetch('/api/process-payment', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({stripeToken: token.id})
});
```

### Backend (NEVER DO THIS)
```java
// ❌ WRONG: Never accept raw card data
// public PaymentDTO processPayment(@RequestBody CardDetailsDTO cardData)

// ✅ CORRECT: Only accept Stripe tokens
public PaymentDTO processPayment(@RequestBody StripeTokenDTO tokenData)
```
